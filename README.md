## Google Summer of Code 2022
This year marks the 17th years for the Google Summer of Code program to run, with more than 17,000 students and mentors across 117 countries, working with 746 open-course organizations.
The programâ€™s goal is to introduce coders to open-source software development over the summer, and contribute to projects from software packages, IDEs, to proof of concepts. Read more.
## Project Preliminary
In this article, we propose the idea of using Machine Learning to identify exoplanets. We used the Kepler Dataset collected by NASA from the TESS mission to conduct supervised Learning, which predicts the existence of exoplanet candidates as a binary classification task, using Neural Networks with PyTorch. The result reaches 93% accuracy at its best.

#How to Run
running the python script from the command terminal/shell will produce a save of the PyTorch neural network, and a couple of pictures for the benchmarks.
